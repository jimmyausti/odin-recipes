        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a pot with water, then bring it to a boil</li>
            <li>Cut up the Bacon (add as much as you like) and add them in</li>
            <li>After a few seconds, add in the chopped up spring onions and dried Wakame</li>
            <li>Then add in chopped Tofu</li>
            <em>Let the broth boil for a few minutes...</em>
            <li>Turn down the heat and add in the Dashi powder (To your liking)</li>
            <li>Grab around three-quarters of a tablespoon of Miso Paste and gently dissolve it into the broth with the help of a fork</li>
            <li>Once that is done, bring the pot to a boil again (but a little lower than last time)</li>
            <li>Crack and mix the eggs, then add them into the pot</li>
            <li>After 30 seconds, the Protein Miso Soup should be Ready!</li>
