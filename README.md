# odin-recipes
Odin Project first project (Basic HTML Webpage)

This project has me looking at creating a basic website which holds information about the recipes of the food I know and want to make and share with other people.
With this, I hope to demonstrate my understanding of Basic HTML structure, boilerplate, best practices and so on.
I also have used this to showcase my new knowledge within working with the CLI ( I use Bash on Linux ) and using Git to save my progress.
